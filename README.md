# tdd_demo

Minimal Flutter project scaffold prepared for test-driven development (TDD).

How to use

1. Open this folder in VS Code or your editor of choice.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Run tests with `flutter test` or use `flutter run` to launch an app if you add a widget and `runApp`.

This repo intentionally contains no UI boilerplate. Add widgets and tests as you iterate.
